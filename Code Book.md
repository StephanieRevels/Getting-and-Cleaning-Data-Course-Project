This data set was obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, which is hosted by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The files contain data on 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years who wore smartphones around the waist. Each subject performed six different acitivites (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while the 3-axial linear accelerations and 3-axial angular velocities. 70% of the subjects were used for generating the training data, while the remained 30% were used for the test data. These subjects were selected using a random sample.

The files that were used are as follows:

    README.txt              : Details of all the files in downloaded folder.
    features_info.txt       : Contains information about the variables used on the feature vector.
    features.txt            : List of all features. (Note: Features refers to the list of all measurement variables)
    activity_labels.txt     : Lists the activity ID and the corresponding activity name.
    train/X_train.txt       : Training data set of activites.
    train/y_train.txt       : Training activity ID labels.
    train/subject_train.txt : Each row identifies the subject (1-30) who performed the activity.
    test/X_test.txt         : Test data set of activities.
    test/y_test.txt         : Test activity ID labels
    test/subject_train.txt  : Each row identifies the subject (1-30) who performed the activity.
